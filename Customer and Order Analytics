#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in order to analyse statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many many unique orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product= 'iPhone'
AND length (orderid) =6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id= FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) =6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product
,price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product
, SUM(Quantity)*price product_revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product
, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
