--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
--Afterward I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Finally I explored the data using the following SQL to ask these questions.

--#1 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?--
SELECT artist_name
, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--#2 Which songs are longer than 4 minutes (240,000 ms)?--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms > 240000
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC;

--#3 Find the average danceability of all songs.--
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS avg_dance
FROM Spotifydata;

--#4 Which songss are more danceable than the average?--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE danceability > 
    (SELECT AVG(danceability)
    FROM Spotifydata)
ORDER BY danceability DESC;

--#5 Which 5 songs have the highest energy?--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, energy
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 5;

--#6 Find the top 3 artists with the most songs in the Top 50.--
SELECT artist_name
, COUNT(track_name) AS song_count
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY song_count DESC
LIMIT 3;

--#7 List all songs where energy >0.8 AND danceability >0.7.--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, energy
, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE energy > 0.8
AND danceability > 0.7
ORDER BY energy DESC;

--#8 What is the most common time signature?--
SELECT time_signature
, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY time_signature
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;

--#9 Which songs are in the most common time signature?--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, time_signature
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE time_signature >= 4
ORDER BY artist_name;

--#10 Find the top 5 happiest songs (highest valence).--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, valence
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY valence DESC
LIMIT 5;

--#11 Find loudest and softesT song.--
--LOUDEST--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, loudness
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness DESC
LIMIT 1;
--SOFTEST--
SELECT artist_name
, track_name
, loudness
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness ASC
LIMIT 1;
